# Node.js Application

## Introduction

This is a Node.js application designed for efficient web service delivery. The project is built using Node.js and is structured for easy deployment, testing, and scaling.

## Branches

* **master**: Default branch, contains the latest stable code.
* **development**: Active development branch for new features.
* **production**: Stable branch for production-ready code.
* **testing**: Branch for testing features before merging into master.

## Project Structure

```
├── Jenkinsfile       # Jenkins pipeline for CI/CD
├── README.md         # Project documentation
├── package.json      # Project dependencies and scripts
├── server.js         # Main application file
```

## Prerequisites

* Node.js (LTS version) installed
* npm (Node Package Manager) installed

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Nodejs.Application

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Running the Application

```bash
# Run the application
node server.js

# Access the application at http://localhost:3000
```

## Configuring Jenkins Pipeline

1. Ensure Jenkins is installed and running.
2. Create a Jenkins job with the following:

   * Set Git repository URL to this project.
   * Use Jenkinsfile for pipeline configuration.
3. Configure credentials for GitHub if needed.

## Continuous Integration (CI) Workflow

* Code push triggers the Jenkins pipeline.
* Application is built, tested, and deployed if tests pass.

## Troubleshooting

* If the application fails to start, ensure Node.js is installed properly.
* For Jenkins errors, review the Jenkins console logs.
